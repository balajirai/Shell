# The | operator (separator here (not piping)) allows for multiple patterns, meaning either "balaji" or "admin" will match this case.
# The double semicolon (;;) marks the end of this pattern block.
# * (Wildcard): Similar to default. The * is a wildcard pattern that matches anything that hasnâ€™t already been matched by the earlier patterns.
